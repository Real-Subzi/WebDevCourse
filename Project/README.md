# CMPS 350 Web Development Course Project – E-Commerce Platform
This repository contains the implementation of our group project for the CMPS 350 Web Development course at Qatar University. The project is an **E-Commerce platform**, developed across two major phases.

The application was built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js**. Data handling evolved from simple JSON files in Phase 1 to a fully implemented **relational database** using **Prisma and SQLite** in Phase 2.

The platform allows three types of users:
- **Customers** – can browse and purchase items
- **Sellers** – can upload, manage, and view sales of their items
- **Admins** – manage the system overall (limited functionality in this implementation)
